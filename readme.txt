This was an extremely fun challenge!
While being a student in the scrimba front end career path and completing Module 3, i decided to jump in head first and tackle my first ever CRUD application. With the knowledge i've obtained through scrimba and previous knowledge through other sources, i figured this would be a healthy, challenging mission to accomplish with my current skill set.


Figuring out out to add an li element on my submit button was the first challenge i faced. After some pro googling, the solution came to me. 
I simply needed to use the createElement, and then use appendChild (using the ul(list) as the parent).

the next challenge was making the "complete" button created by javascript have an event, in this case a click event. The answer was truly so simple that it just went right over my head. Ultimately i ended up creating an event listener for this function within the submit function. Looking at it now, i probably could have created a separate function solely for the complete button, then executed it within the submit function by calling or invoking the function within it.


This was extremely rewarding to accomplish. I would like to use local data storage to be able to store the completed tasks, maybe even had a calender function to create task for different days and so on. But for now, this is a massive win for me, and i will leave it as is and continue another personal project or complete another module or two through the scrimba course.
